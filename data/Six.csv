However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples. Our chosen approach leading to the proposed framework consisted of a number of gathering and analysis processes. First, as a matter of opinion mining, we scanned the scientific interactions from proceedings and presentations of the conferences and working groups mentioned above. Additionally, we scanned the live discussions on the LA Google Groups. Furthermore, we looked back at recent RTD projects that contained elements of analytics and the questions and lessons they produced.    The six dimensions of the proposed LA framework are (cf. Figure 1): stakeholders, objectives, data, instruments, external constraints, and internal limitations.   Stakeholders Data subjects: a group of learners. Data clients: tutor, discussion moderator.   Objective Reflection: Analyse student interactions in a forum discussion, identify network connections between students, and identify isolated students to bring them back into the discussion.   Data Protected dataset: Student interactions and posts in the discussion forum of the LMS. Relevant indicators: Posts published, posts replied to. Time scale: what time frame is applied to the analysis?   Instruments Pedagogic theory: socio-constructivist, hypothesis is that active participants in a discussion show better learning outcomes. Technology: Social Network Analysis (SNA), statistics. Presentation: network diagram visualisation, stats table.   External limitations Conventions: (1) Privacy: is the analysis in accordance with privacy arrangements, are the students properly informed? (2) Ethics: What are the dangers of abuse/misguided use of the data? Norms: Are there e.g., legal data protection or IPR issues related to this kind of use of student data? Time scale: will the students still be able to benefit from the analytics outcome? Is the analysis post-hoc or just-in-time?   Internal limitations Required competences: (1) Interpretation: Do the data clients have the necessary competences to interpret and act upon the results? Do they understand the visualisation or presentation of the information? (2) Critical thinking: Do they understand which data is represented and which data is absent? How will they use this information?","2012","2016-12-01 00:33:50","2016-12-22 03:19:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p><span style=""font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT';"">To validate the framework as both a descriptive approach as well as a guide to the design process of LA applications, we suggest evaluating the growing number of LA application showcases and testing for consistency in the descriptive values of the model.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester’s worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the Q- Matrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2)skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3)our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.","","2016-12-01 01:41:41","2016-12-01 01:52:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p><span style=""font-size: 9.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRomanPSMT'; color: rgb(0.392200%, 0.784300%, 0.784300%);""><strong>eEPIPHANY</strong> is a collection of data mining techniques for automatic discovery of skill models from online course data.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.","2015","2016-12-22 04:19:01","2016-12-22 04:20:09","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>This article is about automatic discover for online learning.

It is already known that access to financial resources, family background, career aspirations and academic ability are indicative of a student’s choice to attend college; though these variables are interesting, they do not necessarily give sufficient actionable information to instructors or guidance counselors to intervene for individual students. However, increasing numbers of students are using educational software at this phase of their education, and detectors of specific aspects of student learning and engagement have been developed for these types of learning environments. If these types of models can be used to predict college attendance, it may provide more actionable information than the previous generation of predictive models. In this paper, we predict college attendance from these types of detectors, in the context of 3,747 students using the ASSISTment system in New England, producing detection that is both successful and potentially more actionable than previous approaches; we can distinguish between a student who will attend college and a student who will not attend college 68.6% of the time.","2013","2016-12-22 04:48:44","2016-12-22 04:50:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>There are a lot of factors could influence a student's decision to enroll in college such as financial reasons, parental support and school support.</p> <p>The result shows that affect and disengagement are associated with college enrollment, suggesting that in-the-moment interventions provided by software may have unexpectedly large effects, if they address negative affect and disengagement.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese lan- guage is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to ap- proach student achievement in secondary education us- ing BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and ques- tionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level clas- sification and regression tasks. Also, four DM mod- els (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Net- works and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct out- come of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of ed- ucation and enhancing school resource management.","2008","2016-12-22 04:59:00","2016-12-22 05:00:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>This paper is using data mining to predict secondary school student performance.</p> <p>Classification and regression are both important DM goals.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Education is a crucial element in our society.</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our detector also distinguishes between two distinct types of gaming which are associated with different learning outcomes.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Program- ming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called the ideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process called knowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has 'mastered' each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1995","2016-12-22 05:26:43","2016-12-22 05:27:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p>This paper is attempting to combine a cognitive model of skill acquisition to bear on the goals of mastery learning.
