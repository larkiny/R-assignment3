This study, through the examination of longitudinal K-12 teacher assigned grading histories for entire cohorts of students from a school district (n=188), demonstrates a novel application of hierarchical cluster analysis and pattern visualization in which all data points collected on every student in a cohort can be patterned, visualized and interpreted to aid in data driven decision making by teachers and administrators. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method. Hierarchical cluster analysis correctly identified over 80% of the students who dropped out using the entire student grade history patterns from either K-12 or K-8.

Understanding how learning relationships form in undergraduate classrooms, as well as the impacts these relationships have on learning outcomes, can inform educators in unique ways and improve educational reform. Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2016-09-13 16:13:27","2016-09-13 16:13:27","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","<p style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; margin-left: 30px;"">1.<span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">In terms of finding out about students social networks, I wasn't thinking specifically of asking students to share their social networking accounts, but&nbsp;</span><em style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"">that might be&nbsp;part of it</em><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">. &nbsp;My initial thoughts came from observing the groupings (in seminar sessions and outside) that my students formed. &nbsp;I distinctly remember two students who were struggling, but hung around together, went to the library together, sat in lectures together and came to tutorials together. &nbsp;It appeared to me that they needed each other for support. &nbsp;Tutorials were often unproductive, but neither of them appeared concerned, and I guessed this was perhaps because they used each other as reference points to check their own<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></span><span class=""il"" style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"">learning</span><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">. &nbsp;If one 'didn't get it' then perhaps the other one didn't feel so worried about also 'not getting it' &nbsp;This is all speculation, but seeing this did make me wonder whether exploring the social networks (online and offline) of those students who were at risk of 'failing' had some mileage. &nbsp;Then I realised that looking at the networks of all students was equally valid.</span></p>","","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2016-09-13 16:13:27","2016-09-13 16:13:27","2013-04-21 21:21:19","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu","","","<p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">I think analytical models based on which interventions are taken or at risk students are identified, should *not* become technically transparent to the students.

The choice of target audience therefore affects how researchers conceptualize problems, capture data, report findings, act on their findings and refine their models.<strong> </strong></p> <p>4.

Also, learning cannot be just measured by behavior, though behavior change is one result of learning, however, learning happens without any changes in behavior.</p> <p>We can not expect to analyze human beings like analyzing programming codes. The connections between learning behaviors and learning itself can be hard to observe sometimes. And the connections between cultural context and learning are hard to capture especially on online learning platforms.</p> <p>I also agree that on MOOC platforms, one problem to analyze learning is the huge wide range of different levels of competencies of the learners and the purposes of them. So we have to go back to the definition of learning and see what learning means to a person. The major two features that have been measured nowadays are achievement and efficiency, though learning includes more than those two factors.</p> <p>In addition, I agree that reminding the learners the connections that they already have in mind (though they haven't realized yet) is really important, which facilitate the development of their meta-cognition.

Learning analytics is one way to facilitate teaching by providing analysis and implications.</p> <p>Also, I don't agree that personalized learning means letting students only focus on their current interests. My opinion is one function of education is trying to guide the students find the beauty of each subject. Therefore, personalized learning also include based on students' motivation and interests, designing a teaching plan for them to balance their learning, and empower themselves in learning new knowledge.</p> <p>In addition, I also don't agree with the point that personalized learning will cause students' lack of ability to compensate in real world life. Learning effectively is one of the goals of education. Technology's development is trying make learning more efficient for students. Students learn through their life experiences about how to compensate, not just rely on learning in class or online.</p> <p>What's more, though students' preferences change constantly, however, technology also develops, and is approaching fast to a better level. The sensitive system is under studied.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2016-09-13 16:13:28","2016-09-13 16:13:28","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;""><br /></span><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;""><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">I strongly agree that one of biggest challenges LA fields is/will be facing is the legitimacy of the collection and use of data. As the values of data increases along with the availability and accessibility of more and more advanced data-driven research methods and tools in LA, the ownership of every piece of data really matters to everyone who is possibly involved in the data creation and collection process.

Some people think data is neutral and doesn't belong to anyone. In other words, it just floats in the universe and waits to be discovered. Another point of view is that data is only meaningful in the eye of the observers of those actions. In other words, it is the data-collecting agents actually entitled the data with values. These are two fairly idiosyncratic views I learned. I guess as the LA develops further, people will have to face more of these fundamental questions regarding who are responsible for what kinds of data, depending on what it came from and where it can be used.&nbsp;</span></span></p> <p>Despite the potential and possibility of data analysis, we are eventually challenged with the limitation of information overload due to the immense amount of information. Information overload, in fact, hampers scientists from performing novel experiments that can lead to key discoveries, because information lead them to duplicate similar experiments from the past. Thus, it is important to understand that data in<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span><span class=""il"">Learning</span><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span><span class=""il"">Analytics</span>, whether big or small, do not reflect every aspect of our class, teacher, and students. Like this, since the immense data collected consistently need to be utilized as meaningful information or knowledge, data mining is gaining attention in the modern information and technology centric society. These knowledge or information can be applied widely not only to education, but also to areas, such as management, production management, research project, market analysis, technology design, and scientific investigation.</p> <p><span style=""color: #222222;

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2016-09-13 16:13:28","2016-09-13 16:13:28","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","","<p>A really interesting topic comparing the experts and the factorization mapping using Q metrics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","","alternating least squares matrix factorization; Artificial Intelligence (incl.

Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2016-09-13 16:13:28","2016-09-13 16:13:28","2016-09-04 01:23:19","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","Porto, Spain","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","; <p><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;"">Through data mining, a student's </span><span class=""il"" style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"">learning</span><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;""><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span>data is collected and it develops a predictive model that plays a key role in building adaptive<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></span><span class=""il"" style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;"">learning</span><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff; display: inline !important; float: none;""><span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span>systems.
