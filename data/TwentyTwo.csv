Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, overall schooling outcomes, such as student dropout or taking a college entrance exam, are identified from the data patterns and compared to past methods of dropout identification as one example of the usefulness of the method.

It requires a thorough understanding of the subject matter and of the cognitive factors that determine student performance. The skills definition, and the mapping of item to skills, require the involvement of experts. We investigate means to assist experts for this task by using a data driven, matrix factorization approach. The two mappings of items to skills, the expert on one side and the matrix factorization on the other, are compared in terms of discrepancies, and in terms of their performance when used in a linear model of skills assessment and item outcome prediction. Visual analysis shows a relatively similar pattern between the expert and the factorized mappings, although differences arise. The prediction comparison shows the factorization approach performs slightly better than the original expert Q-matrix, giving supporting evidence to the belief that the factorization mapping is valid. Implications for the use of the factorization to design better item to skills mapping are discussed.","2013-07-09","2016-09-14 17:32:08","2016-09-14 17:32:08","2016-09-03 20:44:11","441-450","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","en","©2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","","","","link.springer.com","","","","","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39112-5_45","","alternating least squares matrix factorization; Artificial Intelligence (incl.

However, the processes and requirements behind the beneficial application of Learning and Knowledge Analytics as well as the consequences for learning and teaching are still far from being understood. In this paper, we explore the key dimensions of Learning Analytics (LA), the critical problem zones, and some potential dangers to the beneficial exploitation of educational data. We propose and discuss a generic design framework that can act as a useful guide for setting up Learning Analytics services in support of educational practice and learner guidance, in quality assurance, curriculum development, and in improving teacher effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the presented article intends to inform about soft barriers and limitations of Learning Analytics. We identify the required skills and competences that make meaningful use of Learning Analytics data possible to overcome gaps in interpretation literacy among educational stakeholders. We also discuss privacy and ethical issues and suggest ways in which these issues can be addressed through policy guidelines and best practice examples.","2012","2016-09-14 17:32:07","2016-09-14 17:32:07","2016-09-03 18:55:41","42-57","","3","15","","Journal of Educational Technology & Society","Translating Learning into Numbers","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","","<p>Critical dimensions of learning analytics</p> <p>- This necessity motivated us to identify six critical dimensions (soft and hard) of LA, which need to be covered by the design to ensure an appropriate exploitation of LA in an educationally beneficial way.</p> <p>- Soft issues: challenges that depend on assumptions made by humans or society</p> <p>- Hard issues: From the fact-based world of data algorithms.</p> <p>- Six dimensions: Internal limitations, external constraints, stakeholders, Instruments, Objectives and data (see diagram in the paper)</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Stakeholders: Data subjects (group of learners), Data clients (tutor)</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Objective: Reflection</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Data: Protected dataset</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Instruments: Pedagogic theory, technology, presentation</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - External limitations: Conventions (privacy, ethics)</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Internal limitations: Required competences (interpretation, critical thinking)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>- In summary, the proposed framework model in figure 1 above stresses the inherent connections between the six different dimensions and the impact of the analytics process on the end user and the data suppliers.

Social network analysis (SNA) provides the necessary tool kit for investigating questions involving relational data. We introduce basic concepts in SNA, along with methods for data collection, data processing, and data analysis, using a previously collected example study on an undergraduate biology classroom as a tutorial. We conduct descriptive analyses of the structure of the network of costudying relationships. We explore generative processes that create observed study networks between students and also test for an association between network position and success on exams. We also cover practical issues, such as the unique aspects of human subjects review for network studies. Our aims are to convince readers that using SNA in classroom environments allows rich and informative analyses to take place and to provide some initial tools for doing so, in the process inspiring future educational studies incorporating relational data.","2014-06-20","2016-09-14 17:32:05","2016-09-14 17:32:05","2014-08-20 20:21:46","167-178","","2","13","","CBE Life Sci Educ","Understanding Classrooms through Social Network Analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.lifescied.org","","","<p>Case Study:</p> <p>- 10 week biology course with 187 students</p> <p>- They could attend either a morning or afternoon 1 hr lecture (~ 90 st) four times a week, and attended one of eight student labs (~ 24 st) once a week for 3.3 hrs</p> <p>- The total percentage of active learning in the lecture course was greater than 65% of classroom time.</p> <p>- Data collected included who students studied with for the first three exams, all their class grades, the lecture and lab sections to which they belonged, and general demographic information from the registrar.</p> <p>Social Network Basics:</p> <p>- Actors or nodes: can be individuals, organizations, etc. A group of actors and the connections between them make up a network.</p> <p>- A SN perspective would focus in how individuals may have similar network positions due to shared attributes.</p> <p>- Unipartite network: Only one kind of actor</p> <p>- Bipartite network: Links actors to the group they belong</p> <p>- Unidirected: Ties are inherently bidirectional.</p> <p>- Directed: The relationship of interest has a certain direction</p> <p>- Binary or valued ties: Whether the relationship exists (1) or not (0), or additional quantitative info about the relationship.</p> <p>- Static (cross-sectional) or dynamic (panel or repeated cross-sections) network</p> <p>- Ego-centric networks: focus on sample of individuals and the local social environment surrounding them without explicitly trying to connect the dots in the network.</p> <p>- Census networks (whole networks): collect data from an entire bounded population of actors, including identifiable information about the respondents' relational partners. --&gt; nonresponse risk</p> <p>- Network levels concepts and measures:</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Density: How many links are observed in the whole network divided by the total number of links that could exist if every actor were connected to every other actor.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Homophily: propensity for similar actors to be disproportionately connected in a relation of interest (e.g. social selection, social influence).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>","C:\Users\Magdalena Bennett\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\eehjd0hi.default\zotero\storage\UBBT2I8K\10 CBE Life Sci Educ-2014-Grunspan-167-78.pdf; ","http://www.lifescied.org/content/13/2/167","Week 2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption).
