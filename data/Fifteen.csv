Granger-Causality for the masses","R-bloggers","","","","https://www.r-bloggers.com/chicken-or-the-egg-granger-causality-for-the-masses/","<div><br></div> <div><span>When I first learned about Granger-causality this past February, I was bemused and quite skeptical of the whole procedure.&nbsp; I felt it belonged on the scrapheap of impractical academic endeavors, preferring to possibly use an ARIMA transfer function model for the same task.&nbsp; However, several contemporaries threw the red challenge flag and upon further review, my initial impressions have been overturned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only am I fascinated by the technique, in my attempt to discover its value I have became a raving R fan.&nbsp; As such, my first blog entry is to provide some simple code to allow anyone to utilize this obscure econometric technique, but first some background.<p></p></span></div> <div><span>Given two sets of time series data, x and y, granger-causality is a method which attempts to determine whether one series is likely to influence change in the other. This is accomplished by taking different lags of one series and using that to model the change in the second series. We create two models which predict y, one with only past values of y (&Omega;), and the other with past values of y and x (&pi;). The models are given below where k is the number of lags in the time series:<p></p></span></div> <div><br></div> <div> <span>Let &Omega; = y<sub>t</sub> = &beta;<sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub>y<sub>t-1</sub> +&hellip;+ &beta;<sub>k</sub>y<sub>t-k </sub>+ </span><span>e</span><span><p></p></span> </div> <div><br></div> <div> <span>And &pi; = y<sub>t</sub> = &beta;<sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub>y<sub>t-1</sub> +&hellip;+ &beta;<sub>k</sub>y<sub>t-k </sub>+ &alpha;<sub>1</sub>x<sub>t-1</sub> +&hellip;+ &alpha;<sub>k</sub>x<sub>t-k</sub> + </span><span>e</span><span><p></p></span> </div> <div><br></div> <div><span>The residual sums of squared errors are then compared and a test is used to determine whether the nested model (&Omega;) is adequate to explain the future values of y or if the full model (&pi;) is better. The F-test, t-test or Wald test (used in R) are calculated to test the following null and alternate hypotheses:<p></p></span></div> <div><br></div> <div><span>H<sub>0</sub>:&nbsp; &alpha;<sub>i</sub> = 0 for each i of the element [1,k]<p></p></span></div> <div><span>H<sub>1</sub>: &alpha;<sub>i</sub> &ne; 0 for at least 1 i of the element [1,k]<p></p></span></div> <div><br></div> <div><span>Essentially, we are trying to determine whether we can say that statistically x provides more information about future values of y than past values of y alone. Under this definition it is clear that we are not trying to prove actual causation, only that the two values are related by some phenomenon.&nbsp; Along those lines, we must also run this model in reverse to verify that that y does not provide information about future values of x. If we find that this is the case, it is likely that there is some exogenous variable, z, which needs to be controlled or could be a better candidate for granger causation.&nbsp; <p></p></span></div> <div><span>For a detailed explanation, one can read the original paper on the subject:<p></p></span></div> <div><span>Granger, Clive W., &ldquo;Investigating Causal Relations by Econometric Models and Cross-Spectral Methods&rdquo;, <i>Econometrica, </i>37(1969): 424-38<p></p></span></div> <div><span>The R package &ldquo;lmtest&rdquo; incorporates the granger causality procedure, including a data set to answer the age old question of what came first, &ldquo;the chicken or the egg&rdquo;.&nbsp; The data was presented by Walter Thurman and Mark Fisher in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, May 1988, titled &ldquo;Chickens, Eggs, and Causality, or Which Came First?&rdquo;&nbsp; It consists of two time series from 1930 to 1983, one of U.S. egg production and the other the estimated U.S. chicken population.<a href=""http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1476380772205204590"" name=""_GoBack""></a><p></p></span></div> <div><span>Let's get some code going, first loading the data from a saved .csv file.<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; chickegg &lt;- read.csv(file.choose())<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; head(chickegg)<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&nbsp; Year chicken&nbsp; egg<p></p></span></div> <div><span>1 1930&nbsp; 468491 3581<p></p></span></div> <div><span>2 1931&nbsp; 449743 3532<p></p></span></div> <div><span>3 1932&nbsp; 436815 3327<p></p></span></div> <div><span>4 1933&nbsp; 444523 3255<p></p></span></div> <div><span>5 1934 &nbsp;433937 3156<p></p></span></div> <div><span>6 1935&nbsp; 389958 3081<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; attach(chickegg)<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; # plot the time series<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; par(mfrow=c(2,1))<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; plot.ts(chicken)<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; plot.ts(egg)<p></p></span></div> <div><br></div> <div></div> <br><div><a href=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1Gtzau_3n1c/UawDMbtg02I/AAAAAAAAAAo/ZZzZ1H4edng/s1600/Picture1.png""><img border=""0"" height=""319"" src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1Gtzau_3n1c/UawDMbtg02I/AAAAAAAAAAo/ZZzZ1H4edng/s320/Picture1.png"" width=""320""></a></div> <div></div> <div><br></div> <div><span>The plots provide little information other than the data is likely not stationary.&nbsp; I've just started using the forecast package, so let's load it and test for what will achieve stationarity.<p></p></span></div> <div><br></div> <div><span>&gt; library(forecast)<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; # test for unit root and number of differences required, you can also test for seasonality with nsdiffs<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; ndiffs(chicken, alpha=0.05, test=c(""kpss""))&nbsp; <p></p></span></div> <div><span>[1] 1<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; ndiffs(egg, alpha=0.05, test=c(""kpss""))<p></p></span></div> <div><span>[1] 1<p></p></span></div> <div><br></div> <div><span>&gt; # differenced time series<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; dchick &lt;- diff(chicken)<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; degg &lt;- diff(egg)<p></p></span></div> <div><br></div> <div><span>&gt; plot.ts(dchick)<p></p></span></div> <div><span>&gt; plot.ts(degg)<p></p></span></div> <div><br></div> <div><span>Much better!<p></p></span></div> <div><a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-684DEXy_UWQ/UawDOktQQfI/AAAAAAAAAAw/vC2x8euFW2E/s1600/Picture2.png""><img border=""0"" height=""319"" src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-684DEXy_UWQ/UawDOktQQfI/AAAAAAAAAAw/vC2x8euFW2E/s320/Picture2.png"" width=""320""></a></div> <div><br></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span><br></span></div> <div><span>That's pretty standard stuff, but this is where the magic happens!&nbsp; There are several ways to find the optimal lag, which I will skip in the interest of time, but let's say four is the magic number.<p></p></span></div> <div><br></div> <div><span>&gt; # do eggs granger cause chickens?

In particular, lack of success in the core classes of Mathematics and the Portuguese language is extremely serious. On the other hand, the fields of Business Intelligence (BI)/Data Mining (DM), which aim at extracting high-level knowledge from raw data, offer interesting automated tools that can aid the education domain. The present work intends to approach student achievement in secondary education using BI/DM techniques. Recent real-world data (e.g. student grades, demographic, social and school related features) was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. The two core classes (i.e. Mathematics and Portuguese) were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Also, four DM models (i.e. Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and three input selections (e.g. with and without previous grades) were tested. The results show that a good predictive accuracy can be achieved, provided that the first and/or second school period grades are available. Although student achievement is highly influenced by past evaluations, an explanatory analysis has shown that there are also other relevant features (e.g. number of absences, parent’s job and education, alcohol consumption). As a direct outcome of this research, more efficient student prediction tools can be be developed, improving the quality of education and enhancing school resource management.","2008-04","2016-12-21 18:18:55","2016-12-21 18:18:55","2016-12-19 20:46:03","","","","","","","","","","","","EUROSIS","","eng","openAccess","","","","repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt","","","","C:\Users\Josh\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\v5jeaqhe.default\zotero\storage\A4JEE44Q\Cortez and Silva - 2008 - Using data mining to predict secondary school stud.pdf; C:\Users\Josh\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\v5jeaqhe.default\zotero\storage\TIWTBMKG\8024.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the goal of offering this course was to experiment with this type of instruction, we performed extensive evaluation including surveys of demographics, self-assessed skills, and learning intent; we also designed a knowledge-assessment tool specifically for the subject matter in this course, administering it before and after the course to measure learning, and again 5 months later to measure retention. We also tracked students through the course, including separating out students enrolled for credit from those enrolled only for the free, open course. Students had significant knowledge gains across all levels of prior knowledge and across all demographic categories. The main predictor of knowledge gain was effort expended in the course. Students also had significant knowledge retention after the course. Both of these results are limited to the sample of students who chose to complete our knowledge tests. Student completion of the course was hard to predict, with few factors contributing predictive power; the main predictor of completion was intent to complete. Students who chose a concepts-only track with hand exercises achieved the same level of knowledge of recommender systems concepts as those who chose a programming track and its added assignments, though the programming students gained additional programming knowledge. Based on the limited data we were able to gather, face-to-face students performed as well as the online-only students or better; they preferred this format to traditional lecture for reasons ranging from pure convenience to the desire to watch videos at a different pace (slower for English language learners; faster for some native English speakers).

"N32XA5XI","book","2015","Matsuda, Noboru|Furukawa","Machine Beats Experts: Automatic Discovery of Skill Models for Data-Driven Online Course Refinement","","","","","http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED560513","How can we automatically determine which skills must be mastered for the successful completion of an online course? Large-scale online courses (e.g., MOOCs) often contain a broad range of contents frequently intended to be a semester's worth of materials; this breadth often makes it difficult to articulate an accurate set of skills and knowledge (i.e., a skill model, or the QMatrix). We have developed an innovative method to discover skill models from the data of online courses. Our method assumes that online courses have a pre-defined skill map for which skills are associated with formative assessment items embedded throughout the online course. Our method carefully exploits correlations between various parts of student performance, as well as in the text of assessment items, to build a superior statistical model that even outperforms human experts. To evaluate our method, we compare our method with existing methods (LFA) and human engineered skill models on three Open Learning Initiative (OLI) courses at Carnegie Mellon University. The results show that (1) our method outperforms human-engineered skill models, (2) skill models discovered by our method are interpretable, and (3) our method is remarkably faster than existing methods. These results suggest that our method provides a significant contribution to the evidence-based, iterative refinement of online courses with a promising scalability.

Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.","1994-12-01","2016-12-21 18:18:55","2016-12-21 18:18:55","2016-12-19 20:46:26","253-278","","4","4","","User Model User-Adap Inter","Knowledge tracing","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","C:\Users\Josh\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\v5jeaqhe.default\zotero\storage\TKFWXRS2\Corbett and Anderson - 1994 - Knowledge tracing Modeling the acquisition of pro.pdf; C:\Users\Josh\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\v5jeaqhe.default\zotero\storage\JRTIZ8GA\BF01099821.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
